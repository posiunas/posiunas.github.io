## Introduction

Full stack development was easy when I have started building stuff on internet back to 2007-2011.

The flow was like that:

1. Open Photoshop. Yikes.
2. Design the website. Or you are opening a .psd file that you received from other designer.
3. Export assets you need to use as images.
4. Write HTML, CSS and Javascript.
5. Use the template however you want. Usually 

Later I focused more on building HTTP APIs and other backend magic and all these steps went out of my routine.
