## Intro

Recently one of my friends asked for any recommendations on preparing for a transition to engineering management. Or at least getting more skilled in that area. I wrote down a list of my personal recommendations, and I thought I'd share it here also. Also I need to add that the more you read about particular topic, the more you start to notice that everything repeats and you stop learning entirely new things. That's why it's great to read one book, live through it for a while, then read another, catch the repetitions, and so on.

## Top notch, everything I've read

**Become an Effective Software Engineering Manager: How to Be the Leader Your Development Team Needs**
*by James Stanier*

James Stanier (Northhealth, Shopify) is just great. The book reads very easily and everything is written down very well. After this one, there are one or two more books for a higher level. He also writes a blog: [https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/](https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/)

I also really enjoy listening to him - he has a calm tone and speaks interestingly. I found out about him during a conference in Berlin; his presentation was the best one there. For example, here is one of the interviews with him, but you can find more: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5KKtsIVhrw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5KKtsIVhrw)

**An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management**
*by Will Larson*

Will Larson (Imprint, Carta, Calm, Stripe, Uber) is also a fiercely good guy. I read this book right before getting hired as a manager at Nord Security, and now I've read it again. When you read it before working in the role, you realize it's really complex, you have to wear multiple hats, and nothing is clear. It would be more useful if you already had experience in it. So again, it falls into the category of books that need to be read multiple times at different stages, but it's totally on point.

**Resilient Management**
*by Lara Hogan*

Very short, but super universal - not just for engineering, but for management in general.

About engineering, reads easily and quickly. Sarah Drasner works as Sr. Director of Engineering at Google, and has been at Microsoft and Netlify.

**The Making of a Manager: What to Do When Everyone Looks to You**
*by Julie Zhuo*

Universal as well, but very popular in the genre. Julie Zhuo managed Product Design @ Facebook and wrote mostly about that experience.

**The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change**
*by Camille Fournier*

I read this 7 years ago, but it reviews the entire path and roles of different levels - senior, tech leads, managers, VP, CTO, etc., so it's quite interesting. I'm a bit afraid it might be slightly outdated in today's context, but you can probably find timeless things in it. Camille Fournier is also popular in her topic to this day.

## What I started reading recently

**Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager**
*by Michael Lopp*

Michael Lopp - Rands (Sr Director of Engineering @ Apple) is also known for his talent. I think once I finish this book, I'll push it into the Top 3 next to James and Will. It has really great reviews. Stories are the best lessons. I'm also adding an interview with him: [https://refactoring.fm/p/how-to-manage-humans-with-rands](https://refactoring.fm/p/how-to-manage-humans-with-rands)

**Frictionless: 7 Steps to Remove Barriers, Unlock Value, and Outpace Your Competition in the AI Era**
*by Nicole Forsgren and Abi Noda*

The freshest book on this entire list, maybe less about management, but otherwise it has some very good thoughts about what system, ambition, and vision one needs to have in the AI era.
