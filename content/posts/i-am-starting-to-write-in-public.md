It is time to refresh my skills in writing more than a single paragraph on social media or in messengers.

Whenever a random thought pops into my mind, I write it down in my notes. But these thoughts have the potential to be developed into something bigger — like an essay.

So I'm committing to finishing them and putting them out there for everyone to read.
